            <p><span class="page-highlight">Doctor's Blog:</span> This feature will not only give a sense of community for the hospital and patients, as they will feel like they know the doctors better by reading about their interests and their views on not only medical matters but their personal interests. But it will also be a way for the doctors to unwind and share their knowledge about things they have interest in, like art, music, movies, etc.</p>

Any staff member that is able to log in will be able to update this information so that the visitors are constantly informed about the wait times.</p>
